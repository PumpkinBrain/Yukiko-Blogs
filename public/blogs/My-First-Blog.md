# My First Blog

Hi! This is a blog post that I am storing
on **GitHub** and using **NextJS**'s static rendering
in order to have these pages up without me
having to store every single post on my **Neocities** server,
while also serving as a workaroud for CORS policies

[metadata.title]:# Test Post For Storage System
[metadata.tag]:# test
[metadata.date]:# 2025-05-25
[metadata.description]:# Testing a great gambiarra to get this working
