Hi! This is a blog post that I am storing
on **GitHub** and using **NextJS**'s static rendering
in order to have these pages up without me
having to store every single post on my **Neocities** server,
while also serving as a workaroud for CORS policies.

This is an experiment with the objective of optimizing storage space
on my neocities account. Although I still need to do some benchmarking,
cuz of the static rendering I store full html pages so idk how good that is.
But still, It's probably still gonna consume less space than if I stored both
the posts AND the pages so... Win?

## "Why not do client-side rendering?"

You may ask. But then I'd fall on the problem that I would **HAVE**
to store the posts on Neocities because of the [**CORS policies**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors/),
which are pretty restrictive on free accounts. So with this approach,
I can have all of my posts on GitHub and have only the pre-rendered
pages using my storage. Now all that's missing is doing some better
automation and organization of the files so that I can smoothly
publish and edit my blogs.

Now I shall disappear for another while as I practice content writing
and learn about SEO so that my website gains a bit of visibility, [title]
